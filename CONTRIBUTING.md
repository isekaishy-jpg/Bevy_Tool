# Contributing

## Development workflow
- Run formatting and linting locally before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs small and focused.

## Definition of Done
- Builds on Windows + Linux.
- `cargo fmt` clean.
- `cargo clippy` has no new warnings.
- Save/load round-trip maintained for any world-format changes.
- If a feature changes editor UX, include a screenshot or short GIF in the PR.

## Branching
- Use feature branches.
- Prefer squash merges.
